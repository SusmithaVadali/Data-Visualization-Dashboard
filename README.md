# Data-Visualization-Dashboard
The data visualization dashboard is a responsive and interactive layout that displays information using a variety of chart types. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project showcases visual storytelling through data.

The dashboard features bar, line, pie, and area charts, all organized within a card-based layout. The design is clean, responsive, and includes interactive elements like tooltips and legends to enhance usability. This project demonstrates how static web technologies can be used to build engaging data interfaces.
